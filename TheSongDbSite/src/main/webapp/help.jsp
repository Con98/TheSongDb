        <h2>For the Usability Test:</h2>
        <p>1) Just a heads up, currently you have to search for artists and users specifically. (Eg.  Kendrick Lamar, Emmet_Mc)</p>
        <p>2) You can send messages, post status's fine</p>
        <p>3) Due to a change on how the friend system works you currently can't add any</p>
        <p>4) Style is definitely going to change</p>
